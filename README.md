In this file we make use of 3D coordinate system. We define (x,y,z) components of position, velocity and acceleration and deceleration respectively. We make use of distance formula to calculating the relative distance as well as relative velocity. We define the timeframe of the program per second i.e every second parameters are defined and values are calculated including time taken for the collision. By changing the parameters we can get the data regarding occurence of collision or not.
